# Awesome-Early-Exiting-Dynamic-Neural-Network
A paper list for early-exiting dynamic neural networks (EDNN).

The idea of early exiting is firsly proposed in *ICPR16-BranchyNet: Fast Inference via Early Exiting from Deep Neural Networks*.

EDNN inserts **intermediate classifiers** at various network depths, allows the **early termination** of inference for simple inputs with high-confidence predictions and encourages **efficient inference**.

EDNN is also named multi-exit NN in some papers.

We categorized EDNN into three types and collected corresponding papers.

+ **Architecture**
+ **Training**
+ **Inference**

A detailed mindmap of paper collected is illustrated as follow
